# Events Explorer

This is a simple web project that shows a list of events with filtering options and allows switching between two pages.

## What it does

- Shows a few events on the main page.
- When you click the "See All Events" button, it saves the events data in `localStorage` and opens a second page with all events.
- On the second page, events are loaded from `localStorage` and shown with filters for type, distance, category, and date.
- You can also click links to open Google Maps or go back to the main page.
